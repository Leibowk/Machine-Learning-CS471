Problem 4
=========
The data here are from a paper:
"Neural Population Dynamics During Reaching", Churchland, Cunningham et al (Nature 2012)

You can read it for free here, if you so desire:
https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/pdf/ChurchlandNature2012.pdf

The processing to get this into python was greatly helped by the jpca implementation:

Problem 5
=========
The data here come from the following link, "prostate" dataset
https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html

This dataset is used multiple times in the ESL book, for see Table 3.3.
Beware: I was not able to replicate the coefficients reported in this table,
so don't be worried if your coefficients are different than these.
